# PicoPaper
A framework to display images on a WaveShare e-paper display with a PC, using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2.
This framework was written for my own need and use case. I published it hoping others will benefit from this as well. Please have a look at the MIT license below and know that there's no warranty of any kind.
Happy coding!

## Requirements and support
- Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W
- Waveshare 7.5" Black&White ePaper display
- VsCode with the official Raspberry Pi Pico C SDK extension 
- .NET 8
- Display image:
    - Bitmap (*.bmp)
    - Should always be 800 x 480 pixels
    - Only pure white pixels in the bitmap (RGB: 0xFFFFFF) are converted to white pixels on the display. Everything else will become black.

## How to make this work:
- Connect a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W to a Waveshare 7.5" Black&White e-Paper display using their driver board.
- Program the Raspberry Pi Pico with the source code from the pipico folder
    - Use the official Raspberry Pi Pico C SDK vscode extension
- Figure out which virtual serial port is assigned to the Pi Pico (e.g. COM4)
- Use one of two ways to upload an image to the Pi Pico:
    - Use the command line application (picoPaper.exe) to upload a bitmap file
    - Use the .NET library assembly API (picoPaperLib.dll) to send a bitmap from your own .NET application.


## Notes
- This repository contains reference code from WaveShare. Many thanks to this company for their support.
- When using ePaper displays outside, to prevent permanent damage:
    - Keep them away from direct sunlight
    - Use a good UV filter
- For display longevity: When turning off your application, it's best to first clear the display.
